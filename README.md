# Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis with Support Vector Machine and Word2Vec
This project was conducted to evaluate the Police Super App Reviews by implementing the *Support Vector Machine* and *Word2Vec* algorithms. Analysis of 
analysis was conducted by focusing on the keywords with the largest percentage in each aspect, and the conclusions from this analysis were used to assess whether the research had met the objectives and criteria set. 

## Research Limitations
1. The aspects used are service, system and usefulness.
2. The data is classified into positive and negative sentiments

## Data Source
The data used in this study were sourced from reviews of the Polri Super App application in [Google Play](https://github.com/YunicoArdianPradana/Analisis-Sentimen-Berbasis-Aspek-dengan-SVM-dan-Word2Vec/blob/master/Data_Fix.xlsx)
which totalled 2000 data with web scrapping technique. The data is later used as training data while the Generalisation process uses [data generate](https://github.com/YunicoArdianPradana/Analisis-Sentimen-Berbasis-Aspek-dengan-SVM-dan-Word2Vec/blob/master/Data%20Generate%201000.xlsx) 1000 data to determine the ability of SVM algorithm in sentiment and aspect classification.
